# My Wind Pioneers Case Study Submission

I want to preface this with some of my thoughts on this project.
- My task was fairly 'simple' & straightforward: **Make a form work.** I can't lie, that boggled my mind, also ... just two elements?
- I spent at least 6 hours, thinking & implementing what I thought would fit the instructuions as closely as possible but also speak about my skills best.
- I am pretty happy with the end result, and I hope the reviewers (thank you Tom for this assignment) are at least satisifed too.

I would of course appreciate any & all feedback, and I'm really looking forward to hearing from you!
